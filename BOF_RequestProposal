# Name: GREEN metrics 
## Description 

 The first step in addressing these energy management challenges is in measuring, collecting and aggregating metrics to quantify the energy impact of 
Internet technologies in deployed networks.  While there have been ongoing attempts to generate and collect sustainability related metrics, 
these metrics have not been standardized and vary widely between different networks and operators. This makes it very difficult to have a consistent 
view of the metrics in a multi-vendor and/or multi-operator environment. Also, even when the metrics are for similar items the definitions of the metrics 
and the collection methodologies vary widely across the industry. This leads to inconsistent, redundant, and possibly contradictory metrics. Hence there 
is a need for consistent and standardized metrics with precise definitions that are commonly used across networks. 

While this standardized set of sustainability and energy management metrics is being developed there will be a period where a large fraction of deployed 
equipment in the field will be incapable of supporting these standardized metrics and there needs to be a framework to normalize these legacy metrics 
(either from dynamic or static data) to conform to the new standard metrics to support incremental deployment of these new metrics and mechanisms.
