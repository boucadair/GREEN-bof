Marisol introduced the ageda  to be discussed May 13th 2024

** BoF proposal: deadline for draft version on May 24th
get agreement on whether we are okay with the BOF proposal being added to datatracker, acknowledging that we can still change it.  
  
BOF proponents required
BOF participants 

Topics Discussed:

The BOF proposal shall focus on things where we have consensus, remove the ambiguis points
There are some issues that can be closed quickly but some need more discussion (list below) 

Benoit referenced the EMAN (Issue 34) work that we need to distinguish from (write down what is new in BOF proposal)  - referenced   RFC6988bis? or review RFC 6988  the discsussion will take place on the mailing list but some feedback provided that difference may be: 
 YANG modeling, new ITU metrics, devices that are not EMAN enabled, component/device/network level/lifecycle metrics. 
It is not sufficient to have just metrics but to be able to add the KPI to objects in context of the digital map, based on which actions may be taken. trics to the link, based on which we need to take some action; 

The BOF text to include the prosposal, on how the interaction with EMAN is defined. Benoit will help to address this point on the BOF proposal (based on mailing list discussion)
https://www.iana.org/assignments/power-state-sets/power-state-sets.xhtml

Oscar suggested in this group we should aim to understand the metrics, how to characterize the device. 

Discussed further if inventory overlap with IVY WG scope; considered extension to other working groups, not a blocker nor need decision now 

Scope has to be clerly defind, including what is not in scope, referenced the MUD and OPSA WG; Suresh suggested that Regulators shall be out of scope. 

Framework mention twice in the text - need to be refined to be clear. 

Submit the proposal sooner rather then later - need to address EMAN and framework point and it is somewhat good to be submitted. 2 weeks submitting draft and final proposal.

** Issues: required more discussion ** 

* inventory/circular economy aspects?
 Issue #36
 Issue #24
 Issue #23

* Framework clarification 
Issue #32
Issue #25 

Better description of framework might be needed. Jan will help to start this text
Framework might not cover only the use cases under the Sustainability front.

* Liason and Dependencies:
Issue #38 - new section in the charter.
Issue #27 -  more dependency than a chance to influence through liaisons. Industry collaboration is for sure needed.
Issue #17  - influence through ETSI ++ 

not direct work with regulators might be needed, it is region focus (EU, US, ...)

* Out of Scope:
Issue #26 - Routing protocols and energy aware routing algorithms considering green energy factors are in scope or out of scope
Issue #20 - icmp in metrics gathering ? and draft proposals
Issue #19 - Extension to reporting not based YANG models
Issue #13 - ICMP extension as part of collection /Consumption?

** Issues: with easy fixes ** 

Issue #12 - Terminology: includes draft-cparsk-eimpact-sustainability-considerations
Issue #16 -  include the conceptua content of the work items
Issue #18 - refer to normative citation to understand Energy-aware networking . Suggestion?
Issue #21 - Clarify on Energy-aware and Sustainability
Issue #22 - Clarify first paragraph
Issue #28 - Scope of proposed WG, avoid open-ending
Issue #29 - information for IAB/IESG
Issue #30 - Add a URL to the draft agenda on github
Issue #31 - Add a link to the draft charter on the GitHub page
Issue #32 - clarify on the framework related work items
Issue #33 - understading power/energy metrics; include in the scope how to use and interpret them
Issue #35 - include a call out to metrics under terminology under Goals/Scope
Issue #37 - RPC ? Acronym to be Defined

Dhruv Dhody ‚Ä¢ Week of May28th would be first IAB+IESG discussion
There are 4 issues for BoF request (#28-#31) that are easy enough to address

Mahesh Jethanandani ‚Ä¢ Suresh, there are three dates that I see in "Important Dates" - 5/24 for initial BoF, 6/7 for the final submission, and 6/14 is the cutoff for AD to approve the BoF.

Jari Arkko ‚Ä¢ I guess Benoit is saying that if you have tech X to read energy data, then to read from all devices you have to have either (1) X in all devices or (2) something else, Y, in those devices. 

Tony Li ‚Ä¢ Some of us remember 1973. üôÇ

Jari Arkko ‚Ä¢ +1 to Rob 

Luis M. Contreras (Telefonica) ‚Ä¢ EMAN was for energy management, but its charter does not cover the metrics part for instance

Benoit ‚Ä¢ https://www.iana.org/assignments/power-state-sets/power-state-sets.xhtml

Rob Wilton ‚Ä¢ MUD happened in OPSAWG, and in retrospect, a separate WG might have been a better choice.

Adrian Farrel ‚Ä¢ It's not a beauty contest! You don't need a long list of proponents
WHat you need is just a small number who will support very strongly

Suresh Krishnan ‚Ä¢ +1 Jari

Adrian Farrel ‚Ä¢ Good advice from Jari

Mahesh Jethanandani ‚Ä¢ Agree with Jari

Jari Arkko ‚Ä¢ (And I agree with Adrian's point about the long lists‚Ä¶ get a clear thing‚Ä¶ names not so important)

Daniel King (LANCS) ‚Ä¢ Just did a grep of the keyword ‚Äúenergy‚Äù and "power" (excluding roll and 6lowpan type activity) on IETF I-D‚Äôs posted, the current GREEN proposal seems to be the fifth Renaissance for discussion energy-aware networking @ IETF:  2004 "Prolonging Network Lifetime" (PNL), 2010 "Energy Management Framework" (EMAN), 2012 "Power-Aware Networks " (PANET), 2013 "GREEN NET. I agree it would be a good idea understand how this proposal may differ in terms of capability, technology and use cases. Along with several MIBs having been published - some as RFCs. 

Luis M. Contreras (Telefonica) ‚Ä¢ Complementing Dan's comment, in EMAN there is an RFC for a framework. How different is that from the idea of framework being discussed here?

Tony Li ‚Ä¢ Need to drop
