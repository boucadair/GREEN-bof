# Name: Green Ready Energy Efficiency Network (GREEN) 
## Description 

As the imperative to improve energy efficiency gains momentum, network operators increasingly focus on understanding energy consumption usage across links, nodes and devices within their networks. 
Energy aware networking encompasses deploying and managing network infrastructures to reduce energy consumption, optimize energy efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. This will involve technologies to monitor energy consumption, evaluate the effectiveness of energy saving polices, use control strategies to improve energy efficiency, and foster sustainability in network operations.

The goal of the GREEN WG is to develop a suite of short-term deliverables aimed at enhancing energy efficiency within network operations. Key objectives include standardizing terms and definitions for energy metrics, reporting energy consumption usage across different network levels via YANG models, crafting data models for lifecycle assessment to support circular economy strategies, and providing YANG RPCs for better energy management. Additionally, the group will create a framework for the effective collection and utilization of these metrics and attributes. The GREEN WG's approach is to tackle energy efficiency challenges in a systematic and incremental manner, focusing on practical building blocks that contribute to overarching energy efficiency goals.
